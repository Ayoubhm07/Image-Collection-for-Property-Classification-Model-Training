# Image-Collection-for-Property-Classification-Model-Training
This project involves the automated collection of real estate property images from the "Sotheby's Realty" website. The purpose of gathering these images is to create a robust dataset that will be used to train a machine learning model for property classification. The script navigates through multiple pages of property listings, captures images of each property, and saves them locally. These images will then be utilized to develop and refine a model capable of classifying properties based on visual cues, enhancing our capabilities in automated property analysis and categorization.

How to use the project : 
1/go to the file scrapper.py 
2/execute the file scrapper.py 
3/while executing you need to make the driver full screen
